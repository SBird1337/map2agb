# map2agb
A tool to convert Advance Map Files back to their game-readable structures and use them in a toolchain based build system

Provides basic functionality to achieve the above. Keep the following in mind: This tool is designed to work in a
very fragile toolchain, the tool itself therefore is very fragile itself and will only work using AM 1.95 files to store maps
and the game BPRX 1.0 (possibly BPRE only, I did not try a german version) - The tool is heavily WIP and will probably never reach
a state of being finished for release, it will stay fragile and undone - sorry!
